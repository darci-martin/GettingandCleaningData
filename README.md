# Getting and Cleaning Data

#Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Course Project for the Coursera Data Science Course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The data has been collected from the accelerometers on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The data can be downloaded from here:

The code assumes all files have been unzipped in the working directory, and have been unaltered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses. The script can be launched using R Studio.

The output is a tidy data set labeled "tidydata.txt" and is output to the working directory.
